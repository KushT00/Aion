# AION: Client Journey (The Output Buyer)

Clients use AION to solve complex problems without building the infrastructure themselves.

## 1. Discovery
- **Marketplace Browsing**: Categorized views (Data Extraction, Content Gen, Lead Research).
- **Search**: "Find a worker that researches LinkedIn profiles and writes emails."
- **Social Proof**: Filter by "Top Rated" or "Most Used."

## 2. Evaluation
- **Listing Detail**: See what inputs the worker needs (e.g., "Enter Company URL") and what it outputs (e.g., "PDF Report").
- **Pricing Transparent**: See the cost per run or subscription tier.
- **Provider Reputation**: Check the creator's profile and other workers.

## 3. Integration & Run
- **One-Click Install**: Add the worker to "My Workers."
- **Credential Handover**: Provide *only* the specific API keys the worker needs (or use the creator's keys if included in the price).
- **Manual Run**: Fill a form and click "Execute."
- **API/Webhook Run**: Call the worker programmatically from their own apps.

## 4. Monitoring & Management
- **Run History**: View logs and results of past executions.
- **Billing**: Add credits to "Wallet" or manage active subscriptions.
- **Export**: Send results directly to Google Drive, Slack, or download as CSV.
